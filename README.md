# Automated-Well-Test-Model-Identification-using-Triplet-Loss
This project uses a triplet-loss-based neural network to help interpret well test log-log plots. By learning visual similarity across known reservoir types, the model can retrieve the most similar cases for a new input plot, assisting engineers in faster and more consistent interpretation.
